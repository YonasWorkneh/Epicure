# Welcome to Epicure recipe app 🍔🥤
The inspiration to make this app come from noticing the absence of a platform that can offer you a detailed recipe information. And that is how hagurash ( remember not epicure) a recipe website I made as part of IP II group php assignment was born and back then It just didn’t feel right to make it a website such platform should be available on the go any where you are helping passionate people about food make the most out of the platform hence the name shift Epicure(a person who takes particular pleasure in fine food and drink). 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
